With the sports betting industry being worth hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of new odds being set every day, it is very important for sportsbooks to spend loads of resources on making sure the math behind their odds are perfect. Despite all their efforts, there are sometimes signifigant discrepancies between different sportsbooks for the same bets, which can lead to exploitation for bettors to make a profit. Since some professional bettors average returns in the range of 1-3% a month, every edge they gain is invaluable. I made this project to find the best possible odds for bettors to maximize their potential profits without spending hours combing through each sportsbook individually.
